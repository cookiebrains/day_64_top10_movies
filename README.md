Top Ten Movies - 100 Days of Python Project

This project brought together several strands of the 100 Days of Python Bootcamp. It uses Flask, wtforms, an SQLite database, and calls to The Movie Database API. Completing the entire project required some creative problem solving and attention to the details of each imported module. The end result is a clean, fun, visual user experience that would only require some sort of user layer to become a web worthy site.
